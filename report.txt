The player is a separate pointer within my code that runs through a doSomething during every tick. If the arrow keys are pressed a player checks if there is an object in front of it, specifically a marble. If that marble can move then the player and the marble move as one. If there is nothing that the player can push in front of it, the player moves by itself. In both scenarios, the player checks if the next position it will move is valid. That position must either not have an actor on it, if an actor is present that actor must not block movement, or if pushing a marble that actor must eat the marble. The player then moves to the next valid position. The player can also shoot peas when the spacebar is pressed. Although all goodies are immune to the peas.
        If a goodie is present the player can overlap with the goodie. The goodie will disappear if overlapping with a player, play a sound, and gives the player points as well as either increasing the player's health, giving the player life, or increasing the player’s ammo. The goodie is immune to any damage from the player’s peas but can be stolen by the player. 
I implemented all of the requirements in the spec. I assumed that the goodies that the thief bots stole could respawn on top of other goodies and crystals and that this would not affect the thief bots or robots picking up the goodies. I assumed we could use cerr, and that this report could be this short.
